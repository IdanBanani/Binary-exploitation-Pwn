info file (shows elf info)

sudo gdb --pid $(pgrep firefox)   = attach gdb to firefox
p _IO_list_all - > gives the head of the linked list = last file that was opened
p _IO_list_all.file._chain

ds addr - decode int to string
if we have an arena leak which is the main areana , that's also a libc leak.

p &main_arena.bins - all bins addresses are stored in this array (mchunkptr), starting with the unsorted bin

^fd^bk -run the previous command while replaced the keyword fd with bk

gdb binary_name
> start - ensure the libraries are loaded
> ptype /o struct _IO_FILE- print info for a glibc type , /o for offset of each member
> dt FILE -dump type command (neater output)
> dt "struct _IO_FILE" (spaces requires "")
> dt "struct _IO_FILE_plus" (spaces requires "")
