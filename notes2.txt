donâ€™t call your files pwn.py!!! (pwntools)

running your python script from VIM (after youv'e done it once):
Vim command-  :!./%    where ! indicates what follows should be interpreted as a shell command
                       and % is replaced by the name of this buffer.
:!./% GDB (attach GDB after starting the program)

Notice that the heap addresses are different from what we've seen so far,
this is because running your script with the GDB option attaches GDB to the already running  
process rather than starting it under GDB. This means that ASLR is in effect, 
and although we want our exploits to work under ASLR, debugging them with it active can be cumbersome

!./% GDB NOASLR - same as above, but also disables ASLR

ALT+` (like alt+tab) for switching between default termnial windows (bash)

glibc has better protections than most libc distributions

when malloc chunk's IS_MMAPPED flag == 1:
When malloc receives a request larger than a variable named "mmap_threshold", the request will be
serviced via the GLIBC mmap() function rather than from an arena.

data section of a binary is Non poisition independent !

if we have an arena leak which is the main areana , that's also a libc leak.

libc has its own plt alongside two other structures called __exit_funcs & tls_dtor_list

glibc plt is writeable throughout the program lifetime, but it's hard to trigger calls to the functions within it

 __exit_funcs & tls_dtor_list are protected by Pointer guard

 malloc hooks (malloc core functions = func pointer in glibc data section)

you need a guard chunk (>=0x20) to avoid consolidation with the top chunk (or a fencepost of size 0x10)

Tcache
---------------------
calloc doesn't use the tcache (it won't allocate chunks from there)

in 64 operations on 32 bit registers clear the most significant bits of the corresponding 64 bit register.

Exploitation methods notes:
-----------------------------
house of force - no integrity check on the size field of the top chunk
